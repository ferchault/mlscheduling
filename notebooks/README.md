## Scheduling dry-run code and visualisation

The following jupyter notebooks contain all code necessary to simulate the scheduling efficiency with machine-learnt predictions.

- Scheduling.ipynb, to calculate the cross-validated scheduling performance
- ProductionVisualisation.ipynb, to visualise the output of Scheduling.ipynb
- InterruptionScheduling.ipynb, to test the impact of having restartable jobs
